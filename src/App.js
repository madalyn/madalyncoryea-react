            I am a Software Engineer with over 8 years experience.
            Professionally I've done React, C#/.NET, Android, and iOS (but back
            in the Objective-C days). I'm interested in UX/UI design and
            front-end work.

            I am a Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) Alum. I was the
            President of Women in Computer Science for two years, and our
            membership quadrupled under my tenure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy writing, playing piano and ukelele, gardening, mushroom
            foraging and cooking.
